#A few quick observations:
#credit card obviously has 16 numbers in total except for max card number looking like having  17 digits
#date fell between 31st July, 2015 and 30th Oct, 2015. So three-month maturity data.
#mean transaction dollar amount is $86, majority of spendings were below $100. Need to look into min 0.01 and max amounts 999.

#Two observations:
#there is one wrong credit card number with 17 digits
#average credit card limit is around $12000, lowest $2000 and highest $55000

#Let's investigate the wrong credit card number

subset(info, credit_card ==  max(info$credit_card))
max(info$credit_card) <= 10^17

#false alarm. max credit card number is normal and all its events seem fine for location and  transaction amount.

#Let's investigate the min transaction dollar amount
mintran = subset(data, transaction_dollar_amount == 0.01)
sort(unique(mintran$credit_card))

# 44 different credit cards have one transaction of min dollar amount $0.01
